      <h1>What the Hell is Ternary Computing?</h1>
      <p>
        Ternary computing is a type of computing that uses three states instead
        of two. In binary computing, the basic unit of information is the bit,
        which can be either 0 or 1. In ternary computing, the basic unit of
        information is the trit, which can be 0, 1, or 2.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ternary computing has several advantages over binary computing. For
        example, ternary computing can perform calculations faster and more
        efficiently than binary computing. Ternary computing can also store more
        information in a smaller space than binary computing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ternary computing has been around for decades, but it has not been
        widely adopted due to the complexity of designing and building ternary
        computers. However, recent advances in technology have made ternary
        computing more feasible, and researchers are exploring new ways to
        harness the power of ternary computing.
