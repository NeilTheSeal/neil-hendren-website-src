      <h1>The World&apos;s #1 Web Vulnerability</h1>
      <p>
        The world&apos;s #1 web vulnerability is the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
        vulnerability. XSS is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject
        malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. The attacker can
        use this vulnerability to steal sensitive information, such as cookies,
        session tokens, or other user data.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are three types of XSS vulnerabilities: stored, reflected, and
        DOM-based. Stored XSS vulnerabilities occur when the attacker injects
        malicious scripts into a web page that is stored on the server and
        viewed by other users. Reflected XSS vulnerabilities occur when the
        attacker injects malicious scripts into a web page that is reflected
        back to the user. DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities occur when the attacker
        injects malicious scripts into the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web
        page.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prevent XSS vulnerabilities, developers should validate and sanitize
        user input, encode output, and use Content Security Policy (CSP)
        headers. By following these best practices, developers can protect their
        web applications from XSS attacks and keep user data safe.
